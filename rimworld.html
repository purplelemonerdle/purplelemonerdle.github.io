        <ul>
            <li>rimworld is cool and I enjoy using my viewers as my pawns!

            <li><h2>how to use on my channel</h2>
                <p>I use a randomized queue when a new pawn in available. 
                    <br>If you would like to join my colony, type "!queue join" in my twitch chat. That will add you to the randomized queue for new pawns!</p>
                <!--To join the queue, type "!join" 
                <br> to leave the queue, type "!leave"
                <br> to see the queue, type "!list"
                <br> to see your place in line, type "!position"
                -->
                <p> If you would like to change anything about your pawn, use the channel command in my twitch called REVAMP and type in what you want to adjust (appearance, passions, health, etc...)
